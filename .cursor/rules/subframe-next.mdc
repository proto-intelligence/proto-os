# Project Overview

# Development Guidelines

- Adhere to Next.js development best practices. 
- Check if the current project uses Next.js' App or Pages router. Implement pages and data-fetching accordingly.
- Make sure that sub-pages within page use the same page layout.
- If pages use client side logic, wrap that client side logic in it's own component and import it into the page. 

# Important Scripts
